# sublime-collections
Dakowd's Sublime Text Collection

##Windows Version

I used the cracking method suggested [here](https://gist.github.com/JerryLokjianming/71dac05f27f8c96ad1c8941b88030451?permalink_comment_id=5198126#gistcomment-5198126) and checked out [hexedit](https://hexed.it/) to edit the hex code.
Feel free to use this build!
